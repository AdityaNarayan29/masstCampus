# Masst Campus – MVP Implementation & Architecture

## **Overview**
This document outlines a **step-by-step implementation plan** for the Masst Campus MVP, covering:

- Core features: Attendance, Fee Payment, Notifications (Static & Dynamic), Dashboard  
- Architecture & tech stack  
- Development phases with dependencies  
- Deployment & migration considerations  

---

## **1️⃣ MVP Features**

1. **Attendance**
   - Daily tracking per class/student
   - Summary & export (CSV/PDF)
   - Late/absent reports

2. **Fee Payment**
   - Track payment status
   - Partial payments & installments
   - Fee reminders (dynamic notifications)

3. **Notifications**
   - Static: Holidays, circulars
   - Dynamic: Fee reminders, exam results
   - In-app notifications (email/SMS later)

4. **Dashboard**
   - Key metrics: Attendance, Fees, Notifications
   - Quick actions: Mark attendance, Update fees, Send notifications

> **Best Practice:** Focusing on these core modules ensures you deliver immediate value to users while keeping the MVP scope manageable. This aligns with MVP principles: deliver the minimum set of features that solve the core problem, gather feedback, and iterate rapidly [[66]] [[79]].

## **2️⃣ Suggested Tech Stack**

| Layer         | Technology                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Frontend      | React + Next.js + Tailwind CSS             |
| Backend       | Node.js + Express or NestJS                |
| Database      | PostgreSQL                                 |
| Deployment    | Vercel (frontend), DigitalOcean/AWS (backend + DB) |
| Notifications | In-app (Phase 1), optional Email/SMS (Phase 2) |
| Migration / ETL | Node.js scripts, CSV parsers             |

> **Rationale:**  
- **React + Next.js**: Modern, component-based, and supports SSR/SSG for performance.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development and consistency.  
- **Node.js + Express/NestJS**: Popular, scalable, and well-supported for REST APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust, relational, and ideal for structured school data [[7]].  
- **Vercel**: Zero-config, fast frontend deployments; **DigitalOcean/AWS**: Flexible, scalable backend and DB hosting [[9]] [[12]].  
- **Migration scripts**: Essential for onboarding schools with legacy data [[46]].

## **3️⃣ Database Schema (Simplified MVP)**

```sql
-- Students
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    class_id INT,
    admission_no VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Classes
CREATE TABLE classes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Attendance
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT REFERENCES students(id),
    date DATE,
    status ENUM('present','absent','late')
);

-- Fees
CREATE TABLE fees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT REFERENCES students(id),
    amount_due DECIMAL(10,2),
    amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2),
    due_date DATE,
    status ENUM('pending','paid','partial')
);

-- Notifications
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    type ENUM('static','dynamic'),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    message TEXT,
    date_created TIMESTAMP,
    delivered BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

> **Schema Notes:**  
- This schema covers the essential entities for your MVP.  
- For future extensibility, consider adding tables for teachers, parents, and user roles.  
- Use foreign keys and indexes for performance and data integrity [[14]].

## **4️⃣ Architecture Overview**

```
[Frontend - Next.js / React]
        |
        v
[Backend - Node.js / Express/NestJS]
        |
        +--> [Database - PostgreSQL]
        |
        +--> [Migration Scripts / ETL]
        |
        +--> [Notification Service (in-app)]
```

- **Frontend**: UI for teachers, admins, dashboard, notifications
- **Backend**: API endpoints for CRUD, authentication, attendance, fees, notifications
- **Database**: Stores all structured data
- **Migration Scripts**: Handle old data → Masst Campus DB
- **Notifications**: Delivered through backend logic; email/SMS optional Phase 2

> **Best Practice:**  
A modular, layered architecture is standard for school management systems, supporting scalability, maintainability, and integration with future modules (e.g., gradebook, scheduling) [[23]].

## **5️⃣ Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Setup**
1. Initialize Next.js frontend & Tailwind
2. Setup Node.js backend, Express/NestJS
3. Configure PostgreSQL database
4. Setup basic authentication & role-based access
5. Create initial API routes (students, classes, attendance, fees, notifications)

### **Phase 2: Attendance Module**
1. CRUD for attendance records
2. Mark daily attendance per class/student
3. Generate attendance reports (CSV/PDF)
4. Dashboard integration (summary metrics)

### **Phase 3: Fee Payment Module**
1. CRUD for fee records per student
2. Track payments, partial payments
3. Dashboard summary (fees collected / pending)
4. Dynamic fee reminders → notifications table

### **Phase 4: Notifications Module**
1. CRUD for notifications (static/dynamic)
2. Schedule & send notifications (in-app)
3. Dashboard integration → recent notifications
4. Prepare for future Email/SMS integration

### **Phase 5: Dashboard**
1. Aggregate attendance, fees, notifications metrics
2. Quick actions (mark attendance, update fees, send notification)
3. Responsive & clean UI

### **Phase 6: Migration & Testing**
1. Prepare migration templates (Excel/CSV)
2. Test migration scripts for sample school
3. Validate data integrity post-migration
4. Train team members (Mukesh bhaiya, Dad, Bittu bhaiya) on workflow

### **Phase 7: Deployment**
1. Deploy backend (DigitalOcean/AWS)
2. Deploy frontend (Vercel)
3. Configure database backups & monitoring
4. Initial beta rollout to 1–2 schools

> **Phased Approach:**  
This phased, modular rollout is aligned with best practices for educational software and MVPs: start with the core, validate with real users, and iterate based on feedback [[66]] [[112]].

## **7️⃣ Notes**

- Focus on **simplicity, usability, and reliability** for MVP
- Keep **migration and import/export flexible** to onboard schools quickly
- Keep backend modular → allows adding online payments, reports, SMS/Email notifications in Phase 2
- Maintain **documentation** for every module → critical for team handover and scaling

> **Migration Best Practice:**  
Prepare migration templates and scripts early, and test with real school data. Clean, validate, and back up all data before migration. Train users and provide ongoing support for smooth adoption.

---

**Outcome:**  
A structured, clear implementation roadmap from zero → MVP → beta deployment, with **architecture, database, modules, and team workflow fully aligned**.

## **Additional Recommendations & Next Steps**

- **Project Management:**  
  Use Agile or hybrid methodologies (e.g., Scrum sprints, Kanban boards) for iterative development, regular feedback, and adaptability .

- **Security & Compliance:**  
  Implement robust authentication, role-based access, and data privacy measures from the start .

- **Documentation:**  
  Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for all modules and processes to support onboarding and scaling .

- **User Training:**  
  Plan for hands-on training and support for all user roles (admins, teachers, staff) during and after migration .

- **Future-Proofing:**  
  Design the system to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of modules like gradebook, scheduling, parent portals, and analytics.
